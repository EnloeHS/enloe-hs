<h1>Enloe Literary Organization</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>ELO is an extracurricular club that encourages students to come together to celebrate all things creative--through poetry and prose slams, peer workshops, or impromptu writing or drawing experiences.  We produce annually the literary magazine Stone Soup, which is a fantastic representation of the school's visual and literary arts programs. Stone Soup is a literary magazine published annually by the Enloe Literary Organization. The magazine only accepts submissions created by the Enloe student body. Student editors run the meetings and produce our award-winning magazine--from the culling of student submissions to the magazine's design and layout.  ELO is student-made and student-run.</p>
<h2>Meetings</h2>
<p>Once every other Thursday from 2:45 pm to 3:30 pm in Room 2203 (more for editors during the Spring semester).</p>
<h2>Submitting to the Magazine</h2>
<p>Submitting work for consideration in the ELO Stone Soup magazine is a simple process. Work can be submitted through English teachers, through ELO's online account at <a href="mailto:enloeelo@gmail.com">enloeelo@gmail.com</a>, or through direct submission to editors or Ms. Chappell, the ELO faculty advisor. Work is accepted from the beginning of the year through February. No special format is required for the submission itself; handwritten and typed alike are accepted although digital copies are preferred. For art submissions, please give the art editors access to hard copies of the work to photograph or submit digital copies with the largest size file you can. We are not in a position to accept work from faculty or the general community. We are always eager for submissions and look forward to future contributions from the Enloe student body!</p>
