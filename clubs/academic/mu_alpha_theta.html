<h1>Mu Alpha Theta Club</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Do you have a passion for math? Do you hate math but want to get better at it? Do you want to display your mathematical prowess for the world to see? Then Mu Alpha Theta is the club for you! Mu Alpha Theta is the national mathematical honor society for high schools. Its main goals are to inspire keen interest in mathematics, develop strong scholarship in the subject, and promote the enjoyment of mathematics. At meetings, you can learn (or teach) with your peers about an interesting topic and then discuss. You will discover friends who share interests with you and develop a lifelong love for the subject in the process.
</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mu Alpha Theta is a national high school math club. It's for people struggling with basic math concepts and people who are the best in their math class... and everyone in between! You don't have to be a math genius to join; you just have to want to get better! Mu Alpha Theta's main goals are to improve the math skills of students and to get students interested in math. My personal goals are to help people struggling with math and to get people interested in math competitions, because they are completely different than the math you learn in school. 
</p>
<h2>Meetings</h2>
<p>Meetings will be held twice a month on Monday from 2:45 to 4:00 or 4:30. Each meeting will consist of a lesson and a discussion. Each lesson will be taught by a club member. After the lesson (which won't be boring, we promise), the discussion will start. During this, everyone can just talk to each other about the lesson or other math topics, or another club member can talk to the whole club about another interesting math concept (related to that day's lesson).
