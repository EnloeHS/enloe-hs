    <h1>Healthy Initiatives Club</h1>
    <h2>What is the Healthy Initiatives Club?</h2>
        <p>This club aims to focus on psychological, health, and educational benefits that are a        natural result of making physical activity and healthy food habits part of our daily            lives. Throughout the year, we will learn not only about health, but also about its             connections to public health, anatomy and physiology, the climate, and countless other          branches of science.
        We will work to make Enloe a healthier school by focusing on aspects of health including         safety policies, physical education, and health promotion for staff. Through this work,         we hope to receive national recognition from Alliance for a Healthier Generation, and be         the first high school to apply for the Advocates for Health in Action's Brains and              Bodies Award.
        We also hope to spread awareness of debilitating diseases and disorders that can be             prevented with a simple lifestyle change and educate members of our club and our club on         the human body, public health, a healthy lifestyle and how they can spread the word.
        Education and incentive can save lives.</p>
    <h2>Who can join the Healthy Initiatives Club?</h2>
    <p>The Healthy Initiatives Club is for anyone and everyone. Whether you are interested in           the science side of health, want to lead a healthier lifestyle, or just want to see what         this club is about, go ahead and come out to our meetings.</p>
    <h2>What will I get out of this club?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This club will give you valuable information on leading a long, healthy life. It may             not seem important now, but a few years down the road, the decisions you make today             regarding your health will define your life.</li>
        <li>You will get a chance to learn about multiple branches of science that relate to                health, such as public health, anatomy and physiology, and even climate.</li>
        <li>I will work with you to ensure that you receive service hours for the time you                  dedicate to make Enloe a healthier school during club meetings.</li>
        <li>You will receive valuable information about opportunities outside of school                     regarding health and wellness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What will meetings be like?</h2>
    <p>Meetings will generally be held once a month in Ms. Welty’s room, 609.They will last             about an hour after school, from 2:45 pm to 3:45 pm. All meeting dates will be announced         on the 'LoeDown. We will have a variety of guest speakers representing organizations            concerning different aspects of health, and will plan and execute projects around the           school to contribute to our application to the American Heart Association’s Brains and          Bodies Award, as well as national recognition by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation         . As of now, meetings will most probably be held on Mondays or Thursdays, to better             accommodate our speakers.</p>
