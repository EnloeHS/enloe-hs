        <h1>Computer Science Courses</h1>
    <h2>Magnet Intro Computer Science Honors (Full Year) (Honors)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite: Math 1 with a B or higher</strong><br>
  Students will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of computer
science and programming. General computer science topics covered
will include history, basic computer architecture, algorithms, and
computer number systems. Programming topics taught using the C++
language include data types and variables, input-output procedures,
decision structures, basic loop structures, documentation, and a strong
emphasis on modular programming techniques. Additional C++
programming topics covered in this course include advanced data
types, string manipulation, text files, advanced loop structures, arrays,
sets, continued emphasis of modular programming. General computer
science topics covered include advanced algorithms, boolean algebra,
linked lists, bit string flicking, and elementary digital circuits.</p>
<h2>Magnet Advanced Computer Science Honors (Full Year) (Honors)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite: Magnet Intro Computer Science Honors. </strong><br>
  This course begins with a review of Magnet Intro to Computer Science
Honors topics in the C++ programming language. Students will be
introduced to the advanced algorithms for sorting and searching, structured
variables, recursive programming techniques, pointers, linked
lists , stacked queues and binary trees. Also, continued development
of advanced C++ programming with an emphasis on object oriented
techniques. Topics will include structured files, database programming
techniques, dynamic variables, stacks, queues, and operator overloading.
A group project is a major part of the course. Students wishing
to test in IB Computer Science should take this course.</p>
<h2>Advanced Placement/IB Computer Science A (Full Year)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite: Magnet Advanced Computer Science Honors and teacher recommendation </strong><br>
  This course is designed to prepare the student
for the Advanced Placement exam in Computer Science in the
Java programming language. The course includes all the areas
covered in an introductory college computer science course.
Students may earn college credits based on their performance on
the exam.</p>
<h2>Special Topics/Computer Science (Seminar) (Full Year) (Honors)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite: Must be taking or already have taken AP/IB Computer Science A and must have teacher recommendation </strong><br>
  This course will allow the students to explore
advanced topics in Python. Thorough knowledge of and extensive
experience with programming control and data structures
will be assumed, and assignments will be multi-week individual
and group projects. The graphical interface features of Python will
be examined in detail, and the students will learn the necessary
techniques to create professional-style applets. Additionally,
efficient algorithm design and game theory and design will be
ongoing themes of this course. </p>
