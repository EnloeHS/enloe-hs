        <h1>World Languages</h1>
        <h2>Enloe HS World Language Department</h2>
        <p>
            
            Here at Enloe High School we foster cultural diversity and global awareness by offering nine World Languages. A student may choose to study Spanish, French, German, Latin, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Italian, or Arabic. Advanced Placement (AP) classes are offered in Spanish, French, German, Latin, Japanese, Italian, and Chinese while other languages provide upper levels as enrollment dictates. In fact, due to Enloe's commitment to the magnet program we are in the unique position of being able to offer the AP Language and AP Literature in both Spanish and French as separately taught classes. Through the AP courses, many students take the AP exam and receive college credit. The World Languages Department is also an integral part of the International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme. In pursuing an IB Diploma, students may choose to take either standard or higher level exams in Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Chinese, or Russian.


</p>
<p>
The World Languages Department encourages students to begin their language study as early as possible. Some of the advantages of early language study include enhanced vocabulary in English, greater grammatical awareness in English, cultural awareness and understanding, and greater placement advantages at the post-secondary level.

  </p>
        <p>
            Many colleges and universities are also responding to the suggestions of recruiters for the work force by encouraging students in all majors to become proficient in a world language in order to be competitive in a continually growing global economy. In fact, some universities have a world language exit requirement for all its students in every major.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The students enrolled in world language classes enjoy various opportunities to enhance their studies in the languages. Many languages offer activities through clubs. The clubs allow students the opportunity to enjoy such activities as sampling foods of the culture, and attending plays, movies, or performances relative to the language. Furthermore, many students participate in national language competitions offered annually.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As a department, we are involved in activities which promote professional growth and development, including participation and membership in the Foreign Language Association of North Carolina, the Southern Conference on Language Teaching, the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages , and the Wake County Foreign Language Teachers' Academic Alliance. As individuals, we are members of various language specific organizations such as the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese, the American Association of Teachers of French, The American Association of Teachers of German, The American Association of Teachers of Italian, and the American Classical League. We also attend many specialized conferences relevant to our courses of study. During the summer months, immersion experiences and numerous trips abroad help extend our knowledge of world languages and culture.
