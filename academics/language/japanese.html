		</p>

	

	<h2>Japanese Club</h2>

		<p>

			Japanese Club is really cool!</p>
<p>
			The Japanese Club meets every other Tuesday to explore Japanese culture. Some of the 

			activities that are popular with the members are calligraphy, origami, Japanese games, obentou 

			(Japanese boxed lunch), other kinds of Japanese food and snacks, and videos about Japan or in 

			Japanese. Occasionally, the club members eat at a local Japanese restaurant or visit the Japan 

			Center at North Carolina State University. The Japan Center staff explains to students what might 

			be in store for them when they continues their study of Japanese at the college level and also 

			introduces them to the many resources available at the center for check out to the public. In the

			past the club has also participated in open house, orientation for new students, and the school's 

			foreign language festivals where they enjoy sharing their knowledge about Japan and the Japanese 

			language. Because Japanese is perceived to be an "exotic" language, they enjoy talking to other 

			students and parents about what they are learning in class and at the club meetings.
