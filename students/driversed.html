<h1>Class List </h1>
<p>TBD</p>
<h1>Eye Examination Schedule:</h1>
<p> Mr. Graham Broadwell, DMV representative, is scheduled to visit Enloe driver education classes to check the eyes of the students. <u>If you were in a previous class and had a medical form issued to you or an 804 form to take to your eye doctor, you are encouraged to come back to class on one of these dates to update your paperwork. Please inform Evanstein Montague when you plan to come to get your eyes rechecked. </u>Students cannot drive until all vision examination paperwork is complete and signed by Mr. Broadwell.<br />
</p>
<h1> Behind the Wheel Training: </h1>
<p> Please be patient as we attempt to drive students as quickly as possible. When you are called, please remember to write down:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Driving schedule (what time and where to meet),</li>
  <li>Where to meet your driver and where to be picked up at the end of your driving session,</li>
  <li>Instructor&acute;s name and car number. The behind the wheel instructor is responsible for calling and scheduling students to drive. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you finished the classroom phase at least 6 weeks ago and have not been called to drive, please contact Mr. Montague to discuss your situation. If you did not pass the eye exam or get your eyes checked during class, you cannot do the BTW training and will not be called to drive until that is done. Check above to see the eye examination schedule to see when Mr. Broadwell will be scheduled to be on campus.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>Behind the Wheel Instructors: </h1>
<p>Please be aware that these are the drivers that most likely will be calling you to drive. Each is responsible for creating his own driving schedule, so please work with them when called for BTW instruction. If you are driving during the summer or break, you may be called by other Jordan Driving School personnel.</p>
